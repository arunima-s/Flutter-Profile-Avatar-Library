# Profile Name Avatar

A lightweight Flutter widget to generate profile avatars with user initials — similar to Google or Slack. If a user doesn't have a profile image, this widget displays their initials in a colored circle.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically generates initials from names
- Random background color based on name
- Fully customizable: radius, text style, colors

## 🔧 Installation

Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  profile_name_avatar: ^0.0.2
```

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:profile_name_avatar/profile_name_avatar.dart';

ProfileAvatar(
  name: 'Sarbath Shameer',
  radius: 40,
)
```
